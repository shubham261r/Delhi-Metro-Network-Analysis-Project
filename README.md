# Delhi Metro Network Analysis 🚇

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the Delhi Metro network through Python-based analysis, focusing on its structure, connectivity, and efficiency to uncover insights about routes, stations, traffic flow, and overall operations.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how well the Delhi Metro handles passenger traffic
- Evaluate its role in supporting efficient urban commuting
- Optimize routes to improve travel time and connectivity
- Reduce congestion at key stations and interchanges
- Improve passenger flow across the network
- Identify patterns in travel behavior for better planning

## 🛠️ Project Pipeline
To conduct this analysis, we followed the steps below:

- Goal Setting: Determining what to achieve, such as optimizing routes, reducing congestion, or analyzing travel patterns.
- Data Collection: Gathering data on metro lines, stations, connections, and transit schedules.
- Data Cleaning: Cleaning the dataset to handle inconsistencies, missing values, and errors.
- Visualization: Creating visual representations of the metro network, including route maps, passenger flow charts, and congestion heatmaps.
- Analysis: Assessing how effectively the metro network meets operational targets and handles passenger traffic.
